# Ultimate [Drupal](http://drupal.org) starter theme for websites developed by [topsitemakers.com](http://www.topsitemakers.com/)

This is the ultimate starter theme for developing complex and custom [Drupal](http://drupal.org) themes. It is not created as a subtheme to any of existing themes to give you the best flexibility and let you do whatever you want.

The theme is completely built by using Drupal best practices and standards in coding.

### Features

- HTML5
- Most used preprocessing functions already setup (preprocess_page, preprocess_node, preprocess_html, preprocess_comment, preprocess_comment_wrapper, preprocess_search_result)
- Theme settings page
- Coming with custom build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) with 'supports-' prefix to all classes for easier and more semantic browser detection features.
- Clean organization and flexible architecture for robust websites. The <code>template.php</code> file is used only to include all other files in order to avoid having one file with 1k+ lines of functions and overrides.
- Custom links preprocessing and wrapping in HTML5 nav tags
- Basic [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) styles. However, this can be disabled/removed easily so you can include whatever stylesheets you need for your project.
- Responsive layout and media queries out of the box. Bootstrap responsive grid is included, but also most used media queries are setup in a separate file for custom styles (smartphone - tablet - notebook - desktop). 
- Chrome frame for older browsers and no-JS notification
- [Skinr](http://drupal.org/project/skinr) support
- [Panels](http://drupal.org/project/panels) support
- Sample page.tpl.php (quickstart using Twitter Bootstrap grid)
- Fix to merge all scripts and styles into only one file when aggregation is enabled
- Extended body classes to include vocabulary IDs and all arugments of current path

### Todo:

- Additional form alter
- Setup search theming, user profile theming
- Make sure the theme works out of the box for ANY custom design, semi-bootstrap implementation (sketch)
- AddThis (sharing service) / video player support
- Piwik and GA support
- Cleanup maintenance page
- Add glyphicons from bootstrap
- Add body classes based on user role
