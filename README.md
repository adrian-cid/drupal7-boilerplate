# Ultimate [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org) starter theme

Robust HTMl5 starter theme suitable for custom design and projects of any complexity.

The theme is completely built by using Drupal best practices and standards in coding.

### Features

- HTML5
- Most used preprocessing functions already setup (preprocess_page, preprocess_node, preprocess_html, preprocess_comment, preprocess_comment_wrapper, preprocess_search_result)
- Theme settings page
- Coming with custom build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) with 'supports-' prefix to all classes for easier and more semantic browser detection features.
- Coming with [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com) for emulating CSS3 pseudo-classes and attribute selectors in IE8
- Optional reset styles with [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- Clean organization and flexible architecture for robust websites. The <code>template.php</code> file is used only to include all other files in order to avoid having one file with 1k+ lines of functions and overrides.
- Custom links preprocessing and wrapping in HTML5 nav tags
- Basic [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) styles. However, this can be disabled/removed easily so you can include whatever stylesheets you need for your project.
- Responsive layout and media queries out of the box. Bootstrap responsive grid is included, but also most used media queries are setup in a separate file for custom styles (smartphone - tablet - notebook - desktop). 
- Renaming and excluding tabs (local task menu items) mechanism
- Chrome frame for older browsers and no-JS notification
- [Skinr](http://drupal.org/project/skinr) support
- [Panels](http://drupal.org/project/panels) support
- Sample page.tpl.php (quickstart using Twitter Bootstrap grid)
- Extended body classes to include vocabulary IDs, user roles and all arugments of current path
- [Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com) with Bootstrap styles

### Todo:

- Additional form alter
- Setup search theming, user profile theming
- AddThis (sharing service) / video player support
- Support for custom tracking scripts (GA, Piwik, Woopra, Gauges etc.)
- Update with TB 2.2.1 styles
- Unified modal window system (either from theme or from custom module)
